These are instructions to install NeuralGas on an Ubuntu machine.
Probably this code works also in MacOS (however it has not been tested).
Please let us know if you want a version for Windows or feel free to
provide the appropriate compilation scripts.

Install following packages (Ubuntu 10.04 and higher):
qt4-qmake
libqt4-dev

Install the boost dev package. In Ubuntu 10.04 you can install libboost1.40-dev 
or libboost-dev and libboost-program-options-dev. In Ubuntu 11.04 just
libboost1.42-dev and libboost-program-options1.42-dev.

Procedures to install NeuralGas:

Go to the NeuralGas root directory and type the following commands:

$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ ccmake ..

At this point you can provide additional flags to your configuration and type 
the character [c] (configure) twice. If everything worked fine, you can finally 
type [g] for generating the makefile. The final commands are:

$ make
$ sudo make install

Enjoy!
